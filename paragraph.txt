Typo Speed is a desktop-based typing speed test application built using Python and Tkinter. It allows users to practice typing and measure their typing speed and accuracy in real-time. The application displays a randomly selected paragraph, and the user is required to type it within a fixed time limit (60 seconds). It calculates metrics like Words Per Minute (WPM), accuracy percentage, total words typed, and number of incorrect words. The visually interactive keyboard and clean interface make it an engaging tool for improving typing skills.
